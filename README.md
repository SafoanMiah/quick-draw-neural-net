## Overview

[Notebook](https://github.com/SafoanMiah/quick-draw-neural-net/blob/main/notebook.ipynb)

This project involves building a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify drawings from the [Quick Draw Dataset](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data). The dataset consists of 50 million drawings across 345 categories, contributed by players of the game Quick, Draw!.

## Project Structure

- **Data Processing**: The dataset is preprocessed into 28x28 grayscale images in `.npy` format.
- **Model Architecture**: Two CNN architectures are implemented:
  - `QuickDrawCNN_V1`: A simpler model.
  - `QuickDrawCNN_V2`: A more complex model with additional layers, batch normalization, and dropout.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Models are trained and evaluated on a subset of the dataset.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SafoanMiah/quick-draw-neural-net.git
   cd quick-draw-neural-net
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download Dataset**:
   Follow the instructions in the `notebook.ipynb` to download and preprocess the dataset.

4. **Run the Notebook**:
   Open `main.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells to train and evaluate the models.

## Findings

- **Model Performance**:

  - `QuickDrawCNN_V1` achieved a validation accuracy of **89.90%** and a true test accuracy of **84.74%**.
  - `QuickDrawCNN_V2` improved to a validation accuracy of **92.47%** and a true test accuracy of **88.57%**.
  - `QuickDrawCNN_V2 XL`, trained on an augmented dataset, achieved the highest true test accuracy of **95.31%**.

- **Data Augmentation**: Augmenting the dataset with rotated and flipped images significantly improved the model's ability to generalize.
